              The John F. Kennedy Center, Inc. (JFK) was incorporated as a
              private non-profit social service agency on June 6, 1968. The
              agency was formed to address the health, education, social, and
              vocational needs of the lower income residents of a specific
              targeted disadvantaged geographic area in the City of Erie,
              Pennsylvania.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 1968, 100 clients were served through the Emergency Food and
              Medical Supplies (EFMS) voucher program from an old storefront. In
              1974, the present multi-purpose facility was built. In 2002, a
              half-million dollar capital campaign brought much needed
              renovations to the building. Today, JFK is serving 600 clients a
              year through its senior and youth program. Senior center clients
              are attracted from all areas of Erie City. The children are
              primarily residents of the 1.78 square mile area surrounding the
              agency.
            </p>

            <p>
              Funding comes from a variety of public and private sources, both
              state and local.

              <small>B.S.W., M.A.</small>

              <p>Itâ€™s amazing what we can do when we come together.</p>
              <p>
                Samella Hudson-Brewton has always been an advocate for those in
                need, people without a voice who would not know how to access
                health and social services without help. Samella strongly
                believes - no matter how impossible things may seem, that with
                God all things are possible (Matthew 19:26). Samella has always
                been a people person. Her heart was her guide to her career
                choice. That choice led her to Edinboro University where she
                received an undergraduate degree in social work with a minor in
                psychology and a focus in gerontology. Samella returned to
                Edinboro when she saw a need for intervention services in the
                community she served, earning a graduate degree in
                rehabilitation counseling. Samella has worked in the social
                service field for almost 20 years, starting at the John F.
                Kennedy Center as a social worker for the Community Youth
                Activity Program, working with youth and their families. Later,
                she become director of the social services department, working
                with a staff of three other social workers. Later, Samella was
                promoted to deputy director to assist the executive director
                with internal agency operations. Ultimately, Samella became
                executive director of the agency after the untimely death of
                Bobby Harrison, the agency's founding executive director.
